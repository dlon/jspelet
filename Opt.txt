Collisions - F5 (my save), renders ~25 fps and ~36.8 msec SolidMap_Collision_AABB per frame

FIX:
	Less solids - different route altogether...
	Larger bound test as well as smaller (but how do we organize it - sort?)
	...

	std::map? some kind of grid; array with predefined grid
		- sounds memory expensive, though
		- unless the grid is like 512x512

UPDATE: Okay, region thing made the thing hugely faster
